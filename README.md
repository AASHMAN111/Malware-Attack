# Malware-Attack
In this project, I have done a malware attack over Local Area Network making android system as my target of evaluation.
The project was done virtually with the help of simulation tool called GNS3 through virtualization.
I used kali linux to make a meterpreter payload and injected the payload into a real apk file using a tool called TheFatRat
The embedded payload was then sent to android using different Social Engineering techniques
After the apk was installed in the victim's phone we got a meterpreter session in metasploit
Through that session, the shell of the phone could be accesssed and different exploit commands could be run
In the project, I have even done a mitigation to it by using different antivirus program
